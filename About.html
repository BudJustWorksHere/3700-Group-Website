        <p>Welcome to SeattleUEats! We are a free online platform dedicated to helping students at Seattle University find places to eat.
            Since SeattleU is situated in the heart of Seattleâ€™s capitol hill neighborhood it is near an abundance of restuaurants, ranging
            from hip and trendy to local staples; at many different price points. Due to this abundance many students struggle to find a place
            to sit down and eat or grab a quick bite.

                        <h3>Archipelago</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s rare for the chef to check in with diners at the end of the tasting menu and make sure they’re feeling full, 
                            but Archipelago isn’t like any other tasting. A puff of pan de sal pulls apart effortlessly, filling the air with a sweet, 
                            buttery perfume. Burning pine needles and the rich, muscly scent of shrimp paste waft over from the open kitchen. Cooks 
                            walk around with a tray of sliced rib-eye steak, offering seconds. You could easily get lost in the deliciousness of the 
                            modern Filipino food, but Aaron Verzosa and Amber Manuguid do more than send out excellent food. They tell complicated, expansive 
                            stories about the Pacific Northwest and the many ways that Filipino immigrants have shaped it, using words, pictures and even some 
                            unexpected dance moves behind the pass.

                    <div>
                    <h3>Artusi</h3>
                    <p>
                        Spinasse is often hailed as the city’s best Italian restaurant, and its simple tajarin with butter and sage as a 
                        top Seattle dish. Capitol Hill neighbors know, though, that the chef Stuart Lane also runs the menu at the 
                        adjoining Artusi, which, just like Spinasse, offers four splendid handmade pastas per night, at considerably 
                        less expense. The windowed corner space here feels buzzy and urbane, and for $32, you can get every lovely 
                        appetizer on the menu — even the hazelnuts, candied in muscovado sugar with Controne chile and fennel pollen,
                        are especially tasty. The screaming dinner deal on Sunday and Monday — two pastas and a bottle of wine for $45 
                        — is hard to beat.

                    <p>
                        Seattle has many pho options — and you may end up in a real argument if you try to declare a best — but the phở 
                        hà nội style here is superlative. Made with marrow bones from organic, grass-fed cattle, the broth is simmered 
                        for 24 hours and has a fortifying balance of beefy, gingery flavors, spiked with heat from pickled bird’s-eye 
                        chiles. The imperial rolls will spoil you for any others, with a blistered, shattering fried rice-paper wrapping. 
                        And the cocktail menu, inflected with tropical notes like tamarind, pineapple and orgeat, is impressive without 
                        being self-serious. Which is nice when the Vietnamese chicken wings pair so well with, say, a Wenatchee sling, 
                        and the Capitol Hill location is open until midnight.

                    <h3>Jerk Shack</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Jerk Shack, you will find warm hospitality and the best Caribbean food amongst downtown Seattle restaurants. Their 
                        specialty, jerk chicken, is truly out of this world. The best way to eat their jerk chicken is in burrito form—stuffed 
                        alongside Caribbean slaw, sweet plantains, rice, and cheese, all encased in a crispy toasted tortilla. The restaurant 
                        staff treat you like family here and take genuine pride in the food they are serving. We love the outside patio seating 
                        for a tropical vibe that pairs well with the incredible food.

                <section id= "Salumi" class="restaurant">

                    <h3>Salumi</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the days that the sad, soggy sandwich you packed in your lunch just won’t cut it, treat yourself to the sandwich you deserve at Salumi. 
                        You won’t find better-cured meat anywhere else, which makes this the best spot for lunch on our downtown Seattle restaurants guide. 
                        They claim the secret to Salumi’s incredible texture and flavor is developed in their innovative curing process and by using 
                        vegetarian-fed pork that has never been treated with antibiotics. After browsing their selection of uniquely spiced salami, 
                        you’ll definitely want to purchase a couple of packs to use on that next charcuterie board of yours. Your go-to order here will 
                        be the Salumi Cubano. You may not have thought to pair salami with slow-roasted pork shoulder, but it’s a magical combination! If you’ve 
                        eaten your way through our guide to the best bakeries in Seattle, you’ll recognize the Macrina Bakery Giuseppe bread used on most of the sandwiches here.

                <section id= "Nirmal" class="restaurant">
                    <img class="restaurant-img" src="https://www.nirmalseattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nirmals-logo.jpg" alt="Nirmal">
                    <div>
                    <h3>Nirmal’s</h3>
                    <p>
                        Few things are more comforting than a bowl of soul-warming curry served with freshly made garlic naan. Nirmal’s is the best downtown Seattle 
                        restaurant for upscale Indian cuisine. The restaurant is modern with lots of brick—a characteristic unique to the Pioneer Square neighborhood. 
                        If you aren’t in a rush, we highly recommend waiting the 30 minutes needed to cook their biryanis. Layers of basmati rice, meat, vegetables, and 
                        sauce are cooked in a sealed pot. The depth of flavor and incredibly aromatic spices are well worth the wait.

                <section id= "Japonessa" class="restaurant">
                    <img class="restaurant-img" src="https://japonessa.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/japonessaLogo.jpg" alt="Japonessa">
                    <div>
                    <h3>Japonessa</h3>
                    <p>
                        Did you say Seattle? All we heard was sushi. It would be a crime to visit Seattle and miss out on the sushi scene that’s bursting with fresh, local, 
                        and delicious fish. Perhaps this city’s best-kept secret is the happy hour at Japonessa (pronounced “hap-on-essa” due to their Japanese-Mexican influence), 
                        where you can get incredible sushi rolls and sashimi for half the price. Order the Wicked Sensation roll for a taste of their unique Latin flair, and 
                        cool off with the Sweet Seduction roll featuring a tropical coconut glaze. A fresh sashimi set is a must when you can see the ocean from your seat. 
                        Sleek black ceilings and modern chandeliers create a relaxed vibe for anyone looking to enjoy an evening downtown.

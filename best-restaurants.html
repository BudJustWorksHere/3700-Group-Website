                <p>Discovering the food scene around Seattle University promises to be a delightful experience..</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Archipelago</h3>
                    <p>
                        It’s rare for the chef to check in with diners at the end of the tasting menu and make sure they’re feeling full, 
                        but Archipelago isn’t like any other tasting. A puff of pan de sal pulls apart effortlessly, filling the air with a sweet, 
                        buttery perfume. Burning pine needles and the rich, muscly scent of shrimp paste waft over from the open kitchen. Cooks 
                        walk around with a tray of sliced rib-eye steak, offering seconds. You could easily get lost in the deliciousness of the 
                        modern Filipino food, but Aaron Verzosa and Amber Manuguid do more than send out excellent food. They tell complicated, expansive 
                        stories about the Pacific Northwest and the many ways that Filipino immigrants have shaped it, using words, pictures and even some 
                        unexpected dance moves behind the pass.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Artusi</h3>
                    <p>
                        Spinasse is often hailed as the city’s best Italian restaurant, and its simple tajarin with butter and sage as a 
                        top Seattle dish. Capitol Hill neighbors know, though, that the chef Stuart Lane also runs the menu at the 
                        adjoining Artusi, which, just like Spinasse, offers four splendid handmade pastas per night, at considerably 
                        less expense. The windowed corner space here feels buzzy and urbane, and for $32, you can get every lovely 
                        appetizer on the menu — even the hazelnuts, candied in muscovado sugar with Controne chile and fennel pollen,
                        are especially tasty. The screaming dinner deal on Sunday and Monday — two pastas and a bottle of wine for $45 
                        — is hard to beat.

                    <h3>Ba Bar</h3>
                    <p>
                        Seattle has many pho options — and you may end up in a real argument if you try to declare a best — but the phở 
                        hà nội style here is superlative. Made with marrow bones from organic, grass-fed cattle, the broth is simmered 
                        for 24 hours and has a fortifying balance of beefy, gingery flavors, spiked with heat from pickled bird’s-eye 
                        chiles. The imperial rolls will spoil you for any others, with a blistered, shattering fried rice-paper wrapping. 
                        And the cocktail menu, inflected with tropical notes like tamarind, pineapple and orgeat, is impressive without 
                        being self-serious. Which is nice when the Vietnamese chicken wings pair so well with, say, a Wenatchee sling, 
                        and the Capitol Hill location is open until midnight.

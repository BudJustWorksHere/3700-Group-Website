                <p>
                    Experiencing Capitol Hill nightlife is like fiddling with a faulty remote control car: you never know 
                    which way it’s going to go, but it’s a really eventful time regardless. Plan any big night out that involves 
                    bar-hopping, and chances are you’ll decide on Capitol Hill—and with good reason. There’s a quality mix of 
                    cocktail bars where you can host your knitting circle alongside places where you’ll feel the need to yell, 
                    “Down the hatch, people!” That’s why we love it. Here are our favorite places to drink on the Hill.

                            episode, and the fact that half the establishment shifts into a night club past 10pm, swing by and slurp liters of German lager
                            served in glass boots. You can also eat things like schnitzel sliders and comically large pretzels with tasty
                            beer cheese, all while watching some sports or paying 10 dollars an hour to play bocce extremely competitively
                            until your friends hate each other.

                            decor of vinyls. This bar tends to have a calmer vibe then the average cap hill bar, making it a great place to
                            go on a date or talk with friends. Even though the place is a bit pricey compared to other places on this list,
                            it makes up for it with ambiance and its large menu of vegan options for those less meat inclined. Definetly not
                            the best place if your a college student trying to get the most drinks out of their budget.

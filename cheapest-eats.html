                            Dave's Hot Chicken is a fast-casual restaurant chain that has quickly gained a cult following for its Nashville-style hot chicken. Founded in 2017 in Los Angeles, California, by best friends Dave Kopushyan, Arman Oganesyan, and brothers Tommy and Gary Rubenyan, the brand started as a humble pop-up in a parking lot. The overwhelming popularity of their spicy, flavorful chicken led to rapid expansion, with numerous locations opening across the United States and beyond. The star of the menu at Dave's Hot Chicken is, unsurprisingly, the hot chicken, which is served in various forms including tenders and sliders. Customers can customize their heat level, choosing from seven options ranging from "No Spice" to the fiery "Reaper," which is made with the Carolina Reaper pepper, one of the hottest peppers in the world. This allows diners to tailor their meal to their personal spice tolerance, making it accessible to a wide audience.

                                CheBogz serves classic Filipino favorites like chicken adobo, pancit, and lumpia in semi-regular rotations at South Lake Union, 
                                Beacon Hill’s Sinclair gas station, Ravenna Brewery, and Ridgecrest Public House. CheBogz is the project of sisters Trixia and 
                                Paula of the Paraiso family — known for their Beacon Hill restaurant Kusina Filipina, which shuttered in 2017 after the building 
                                was sold and the rent was raised. The Paraisos acquired other turnkey Filipino restaurants in Federal Way and Tacoma, and the sisters 
                                branched out with a food truck business. Expect to see CheBogz expand to a brick and mortar at Beacon Hill’s Colina Apartments in the near future.
